title: "Proposal"
---

This proposal is to explore the synergy of community, technology, and company through the use of human ideas augmented by AI.

## Phases

1.  **Phase 1: Content Creation**
    Humans from Oppkey work with the AI to be a site with content.

2.  **Phase 2: Expert Vetting**
    Oppkey reaches out to developers and security experts to vet the site and propose changes.

3.  **Phase 3: Community Collaboration**
    We work with the community to improve the site.

4.  **Phase 4: Content Cycle**
    The cycle is repeated with new content.

## Example of Real People Working with a Site

An example of this model in action can be seen at the [R Beats Python Community page](https://oppkey.github.io/r-beats-python/community.html).

## Community Engagement Evolution

The diagram illustrates the evolution of community engagement through two phases:

**Left side (Current State):** Shows a smaller crossover between community and technology, with limited intersection between the three domains.

**Right side (Enhanced Engagement):** Demonstrates a stronger crossover between community, company, and technology through the use of a community engagement campaign. The center crossover area grows from 10% to 30%, representing the expanded intersection where community discussions, technology trends, and company awareness converge.
