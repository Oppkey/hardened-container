## Mission

The Security Isolation Imperative is an educational project exploring the fundamental shift in container security from shared-kernel architectures to architectural isolation. In the AI era, traditional security approaches are insufficient—we need a new baseline that eliminates entire classes of attacks through design.

This site serves as a neutral resource for the entire hardened runtime ecosystem, providing clear, technical, and evidence-backed analysis to help teams make informed decisions about their security architecture.

## The AI Threat Landscape

The rapid advancement of AI capabilities has fundamentally changed the security landscape. Traditional detection-based security approaches are becoming less effective against AI-powered attacks that can:

- **Adapt in Real-Time**: AI attackers can modify their techniques faster than detection systems can update
- **Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**: AI can discover and exploit vulnerabilities before patches are available
- **Bypass Traditional Defenses**: AI can learn to evade signature-based detection systems

This new reality requires a fundamental shift from reactive detection to proactive prevention through architectural isolation.

## Who We Are

Security-focused developers and technical writers working with a community of independent technologists who contribute their expertise and insights with the use of AI.

## Stewardship

This project is stewarded by Edera, the primary founder and sponsor of the Security Isolation Imperative. Edera's role is to:

- **Provide Resources**: Fund the development and maintenance of this educational platform
- **Ensure Neutrality**: Maintain editorial independence while providing technical expertise
- **Foster Collaboration**: Welcome contributions from across the hardened runtime ecosystem
- **Advance the Movement**: Support the broader shift toward architectural security isolation

## Community Collaboration

We believe that advancing security isolation requires collaboration across the entire ecosystem. This site welcomes contributions from:

- **Open Source Projects**: Kata Containers, gVisor, and other hardened runtime projects
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and others
- **Security Researchers**: Independent researchers and academic institutions
- **Platform Teams**: DevOps and security engineers from organizations of all sizes

## Transparency and Accountability

The unique attribute of this site is that people work with AI to give their opinions, content, and suggestions under their real names. This transparency and accountability ensures authentic, credible perspectives from the community.

## Use of AI

We believe that technologists and developers should use AI to augment human ideas. We use AI to:

- understand the latest trends in the industry
- research the latest tools, technologies, best practices, and the 
  latest security threats and vulnerabilities.
- write, edit, and review content
